# First-Game-
My name is Houssam I'm a 25 year old from Chicago and this is my first solo game. I built it using Python's Pygame after a couple months of watching tutorials I decided to apply my knowledge and try to create my own fighting style game. The game definitely has some bugs and issues but its playable and has all the basic functions and mechanics you'd expect like moving, jumping, animations, and game over screen.  Player controls can be found at the start of the code.I really look forward to doing many more projects this is the first of many. I'm very passionate about this exciting journey of Game Development.
